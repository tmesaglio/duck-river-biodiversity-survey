Species discovery has not stopped!     

For some taxa, I'm confident that I've observed or identified all species currently present within the survey area. For many groups, however, the species I recorded during my survey are probably only scratching the surface. Some of the more obvious of these, and some of the low-hanging fruit, include:

Nocturnal mammals   
Fungi (including lichens)   
Bryophytes   
Leaf litter invertebrates   
Plant taxa such as *Lepidosperma*, *Plantago*, *Vittadinia*, *Verbena* and *Gamochaeta* (for which I'm reasonably sure I'm currently overlooking cryptic diversity in the survey area)       
Aquatic taxa    
Grasses    
Galls and leaf miners

If anyone has ideas for surveying these groups, wants to collaborate on any project related to my survey area, or is interested in simply visiting and checking out some of the species I've found, I'd love to hear from you!
