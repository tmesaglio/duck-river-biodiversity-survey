In 2020, I was looking for new green spaces to explore in western Sydney. In late April, I stumbled upon Wategora Reserve for the first time, having never visited it (or even known of its existence) beforehand. I visited a second time in early May, but then largely forgot about the reserve. In early September, however, I was starting to go a little bit crazy being stuck inside all the time during COVID lockdowns, and decided to visit Wategora again now that it was spring. After reading an information sign in the reserve, I became aware of the *'Price List'*
