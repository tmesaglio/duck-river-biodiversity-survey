I'm a PhD candidate at the University of New South Wales Sydney; my thesis focuses on quantifying our knowledge of Australian plant biodiversity, and developing identification tools, survey and species description protocols, and general data frameworks for improving this knowledge. Although most of my research over the past feq years has focused on analyses of citizen science data, I've published scientific papers across a wide range of disciplines, including marine forensics, bushfire recovery and invertebrate ecology and taxonomy.
