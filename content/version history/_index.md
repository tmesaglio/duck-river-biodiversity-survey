**Version 1.1 - released 17 December 2022**

*Summary:* 
-	New section added
-	2 new species added/identified from existing observations
-	Refined identification for 2 species
-	Coarsened identification for 2 species due to misidentifications (both still maintained as unique morphospecies)
-	Description and photographic voucher updated for 1 species
-	Correction of 1 factual error
-	Updated non-native plant species count
-	Updated number of iNaturalist identifiers
-	Total species count updated to 1928.

*Details:*
-	Section 12, 'Version history', added to clearly document changes made with each new version
-	New species of huntsman added after new identification added to existing observation: *Heteropoda jugulans*
-	New species of eucalypt added after correcting identification added to existing observation: *Eucalyptus albens* 
-	Existing ant species, 'Myrmicinae, unidentified sp.1, refined to *Tetramorium* sp. (and thus 'Myrmicinae, unidentified sp.2' becomes 'Myrmicinae, unidentified sp.1', and 'Myrmicinae, unidentified sp.3' becomes 'Myrmicinae, unidentified sp.2')
-	Existing ladybird species, 'Coccinellidae, unidentified sp.2', refined to 'Coccidulinae, unidentified' (and thus 'Coccinellidae, unidentified sp.1' becomes 'Coccinellidae, unidentified')
-	Existing chrysomelid species, *Lamprolina aeneipennis*, was misidentified, so downgraded to *Lamprolina* sp. Also updated photographic voucher
-	Existing mushroom species, *Formitiporia robusta*, was misidentified, so downgraded to 'Hymenochaetaceae, unidentified'

-	In Section 1, under the subsection 'Historical surveys', corrected the statement that Gibson's unpublished 1990 list was meant to be published as 'Appendix No. One' in the Duck River Open-Space Bushland Survey. Appendix No. One was actually meant to be Price's 1988 list, and Gibson's list was meant to be published as an addendum to Appendix No. One, with neither being published
-	In Section 3, updated the number of non-native plant species from 308 to 309
-	In Section 1, updated the number of iNaturalist identifiers from 687 to 690
