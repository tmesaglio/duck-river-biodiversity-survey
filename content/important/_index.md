Whilst there are many plant species that are significant or locally rare within the survey area, represented by just one or a small handful of individuals, a lot of these are more common/widely distributed across Sydney or NSW. However, as listed by James, McDougall and Benson in their 1999 [Rare Bushland Plants of Western Sydney (2nd edition)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331586736_Rare_Bushland_Plants_of_Western_Sydney_Second_edition_1999), there are five regionally significant plants considered rare in Western Sydney that I've observed in the reserve. 

1. *Acacia pubescens*   
Endemic to the Sydney region, this threatened wattle is listed as vulnerable under federal legislation. Much of its remaining occurrences are as very small patches or individuals along trainlines or roadsides, however, Wategora Reserve is one of its last bastions; it's common and widespread throughout almost all sections of the survey area, with many large patches formed by suckering.
