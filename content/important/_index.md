Whilst there are many plant species that are significant or locally rare within the survey area, represented by just one or a small handful of individuals, a lot of these are more common/widely distributed across Sydney or NSW. However, as listed by James, McDougall and Benson in their 1999 [Rare Bushland Plants of Western Sydney (2nd edition)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331586736_Rare_Bushland_Plants_of_Western_Sydney_Second_edition_1999), there are five regionally significant plants considered rare in Western Sydney that I've observed in the reserve.
