Because my survey was designed to be comprehensive, I did not run any quadrats, transects, etc., but rather continuously surveyed the entire reserve ad nauseum. Most of the species I recorded were observed through simple active searching, but I also set up a UV lamp and moth sheet during many of my night surveys to survey insects. I endeavoured to survey as non-destructively as possible, but I did collect some insect specimens to send to experts for identification. I also collected a number of plant specimens and deposited them at the NSW Herbarium, some for identification and others for their value as vouchers. 

My photographs were taken with a Nikon D5600 (upgraded to a Nikon D7500 during the survey) with a Tamron 18-400 lens, an Olympus Tough TG-5, and an iPhone 6s (upgraded to an iPhone 2020 SE during the survey). Since 2023, I have been using a Canon EOS M50 Mii with 28 mm macro lens in place of the Olympus Tough TG-5.
