[{"content":"In 2020, I was looking for new green spaces to explore in western Sydney. In late April, I stumbled upon Wategora Reserve for the first time, having never visited it (or even known of its existence) beforehand. I visited a second time in early May, but then largely forgot about the reserve. In early September, however, I was starting to go a little bit crazy being stuck inside all the time during COVID lockdowns, and decided to visit Wategora again now that it was spring. After reading an information sign in the reserve, I became aware of the ‘Price List’\nThis list was a (formally unpublished) report produced by knowledgeable local Tony Price in 1979, after three years (1976-1978) of comprehensively surveying Wategora Reserve (and the nearby Rookwood Cemetery) for vascular plants. His report was published by Alison Hewitt as an appendix in her 2013 paper Revisiting Tony Price’s (1979) account of the native vegetation of Duck River and Rookwood Cemetery, western Sydney\nIn 1988, Price produced a second, updated list of native species for Wategora Reserve based on his continued observations and surveys since 1979, although this list was not made publicly accessible or published in any format; I have Colin Gibson to thank for kindly providing me with a physical copy of this document. In addition to these two lists, Judith Rawlings and John Neff conducted a brief survey of the non-native plant species in Wategora Reserve from November-December 1990; this was published as ‘Appendix No. Two’ in the 1990 physical document Duck River Open-Space Bushland Survey. Colin Gibson also produced an addendum (with one contribution from Francine Bell) of additional native species in the reserve, based on his observations from 1988-1992, that had not been observed by Price from 1976-1988, which he also shared with me.\nI consolidated these four historical species lists into a single master historical list, updated all names, and removed and changed species based on misidentifications and other errors. From 1976-1992, a total of 522 vascular plant species were recorded from Wategora Reserve, including 285 native species from 1988-1992 and 237 non-native species from 1976-1990.\nAfter that September visit, my aim therefore became to comprehensively survey the reserve: for vascular plants, to allow a comparison with these historical data; and, for all other taxa, to establish important baseline data.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Background","uri":"/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/background/"},{"content":"Stretching ~1.3 km from north to south, and ~350 m at its widest point, my survey area covered ~25 ha (0.25 km2) across Wategora Reserve and, immediately south of it, the riverine vegetation adjacent to Everley Park. Located in western Sydney, New South Wales, the survey area spans the suburbs of Chester Hill and South Granville, and is under the jurisdiction of Cumberland Council. It is in a highly urbanised area, and is surrounded by sporting fields, a golf course, and industrial estates and commercial properties.\nThe survey area can be split into two sections. The southern section is what I refer to as the southern riverine stretch, and consists of the eastern section of Everley Park, the riverine vegetation to the immediate east of the park, and Duck River. This vegetation belongs to the critically endangered ecological community Sydney Coastal River Flat Forest, specifically the Alluvial Woodland form, however, it is highly degraded and weed-infested. This section of the creek and its vegetation have undergone extensive management in the past few decades, including spraying and removal of weeds, native species plantings, and erosion control. In particular, much of the native mid- and understorey along this stretch has been planted or has self-seeded from plantings. The map below shows this section.\nThe northern section constitutes Wategora Reserve itself, including Duck River and a small tributary of it extending westwards into the reserve. The riverine vegetation along the creek is also Sydney Coastal River Flat Forest, but the core vegetation throughout the reserve is Cooks River/Castlereagh Ironbark Forest [in the Sydney Basin], also a critically endangered community. The reserve has also undergone extensive management in the past few decades, including spraying and removal of weeds, native species plantings, and erosion control, but much of the vegetation is remnant/naturally occurring. The map below shows this section.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Maps and site information","uri":"/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/maps/"},{"content":"I will keep this section brief, as it is comprehensively treated within my final report itself, but the survey area is threatened by a myriad of processes and entities, including (but not limited to) the invasion by non-native species, erosion, weather extremes, pollution, and inadequate management.\nUndoubtedly, the most significant current threat to the reserve’s biodiversity is the proliferation and spread of non-native plants. During my survey I observed 308 non-native plant species, exceeding the number of natives (287). Although many of these non-natives are having little to no impact on biodiversity in the survey area, e.g., singular occurrences of garden escapees such as Dimorphotheca ecklonia or Dracaena draco, a great number of non-native plant species are negatively impacting the survey area’s biodiversity right now, with impacts including altered water flow, spread of disease, creation of excess shade, smothering of native trees and shrubs, and outcompetition/displacement of native species.\nProbably the greatest threat out of any non-native plant species in the survey area is the grass Ehrharta erecta. It has spread and proliferated into almost every section in the entire survey area, including the most intact and otherwise weed-free sections of bushland and woodland. Even within the short timespan of my survey, I watched it spread and increase in abundance, responding especially positively after heavy rain in 2022. In some areas, it has formed astonishingly large patches to the detriment of all other grasses and herbs. I suspect it is far too late to eliminate it entirely from the survey area, and control efforts may have to be limited to halting any further spread. Although always abundant along the creek during my survey, Tradescantia fluminensis has also exploded throughout 2022, also in response to rain, and is one of the biggest threats after Ehrharta erecta. It has now begun to invade bushland at a number of locations (e.g., it has already crept into the edges of the southern grassy woodland, and almost entirely smothered the Macrozamia spiralis growing there) and should be one of the highest priorities to deal with.\nNotably, I also observed three naturalised, non-native plant species within Wategora Reserve that were previously unrecorded by PlantNET as naturalised in NSW: Rothmannia globosa, Salvia hispanica and Ruta chalepensis.\nThe photo below highlights the now total dominance of the undergrowth by Ehrharta erecta in many sections of the reserve.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Threats","uri":"/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/threats/"},{"content":"Whilst there are many plant species that are significant or locally rare within the survey area, represented by just one or a small handful of individuals, a lot of these are more common/widely distributed across Sydney or NSW. However, as listed by James, McDougall and Benson in their 1999 Rare Bushland Plants of Western Sydney (2nd edition), there are five regionally significant plants considered rare in Western Sydney that I’ve observed in the reserve.\nVincetoxium woollsii This is the most significant plant, and perhaps the most significant species in general, that I recorded from the survey area. This is a federally and state-listed endangered species. After first being collected in the 1860s at Parramatta, it was not seen in Sydney until 1999, and indeed in the 1999 Rare Bushland Plants of Western Sydney, this species was listed as “now believed extinct in Sydney region”. However, a small patch was discovered by Colin Gibson in Norfolk Reserve, Chullora (~5.6 km southeast of Wategora Reserve). That patch seemingly died out in the early 2000s during the Millennium Drought, but has now reappeared there after heavy rains during the La Ni\\tex{~n}a conditions of the past couple of years. In November 2021, I found two individuals growing at the base of a Eucalyptus fibrosa in the reserve, a significant discovery. This population is currently unprotected and under considerable threat, with Ehrharta erecta constantly threatening to smother the two plants, and oleander aphids (Aphis nerii) attacking and defoliating the plants after jumping across from nearby patches of the invasive climber Araujia sericifera. Conserving this population should be a high priority. In late November 2021, Daniel Smart collected a small cutting (under license) of one of the two individuals and propagated it in his greenhouse. It grew rapidly, and in late September 2022 it began to flower prolifically. Flowering is yet to occur at the in situ population. Acacia pubescens\nEndemic to the Sydney region, this threatened wattle is listed as vulnerable under federal legislation. Much of its remaining occurrences are as very small patches or individuals along trainlines or roadsides, however, Wategora Reserve is one of its last bastions; it’s common and widespread throughout almost all sections of the survey area, with many large patches formed by suckering. Callistemon linearifolius Listed as vulnerable at a state level, this threatened bottlebrush is listed as a ‘data-deficient’ species by the Saving Our Species program. Scattered individuals and small stands are present throughout the reserve, totalling ~15-20 individuals. Solenogyne dominii This small Asteraceae is relatively rare in Sydney. I recorded this species at only three locations within the survey area, all of them in the northern bushland, and two of them represented by just one individual. Stackhousia muricata Another species with very few collections from Sydney, and even fewer recent records. This species appeared across a number of sections of bushland in the reserve immediately after heavy rain in mid-November 2021.

Although most of my research over the past few years has focused on analyses of citizen science data, I’ve published scientific papers across a wide range of disciplines, including marine forensics, bushfire recovery and invertebrate ecology and taxonomy. You can view my papers and other academic works at this link.\nI’ve worked a lot on bushfire-related research over the past few years, mostly relating to documenting the recovery/return of organisms in/to firegrounds, and was honoured to receive the 2022 Department of Industry, Science and Resources Eureka Prize for Innovation in Citizen Science as part of the Environment Recovery Project team.\nI’m heavily involved in BioBlitzes across Australia as an organiser, survey leader and participant. I organised the City Nature Challenge for Sydney from 2020-2022, was one of the founding organisers of the Great Southern BioBlitz and organised the Sydney effort from 2020-2022, and co-organised the 2022 Big Bushfire BioBlitzes with Casey Kirchhoff. I also recently attended the 2022 Desert Discovery expedition to Yeo Lake Nature Reserve on the western edge of the Great Victoria Desert in Western Australia, and did almost four weeks of BioBlitzing across Western Australia with Nick Lambert, Pete Crowcroft, Ruby Stephens and Sophie Yang as part of fieldwork for my PhD, taking ~39,000 photographs of \u003e1600 species during this time.\nI’m a huge proponent of the online biodiversity citizen science platform iNaturalist, on which I’m a curator and forum moderator. I’ve uploaded over 39,000 observations to the platform across almost 6000 species, and have made \u003e227,000 identifications for other users. You can find me on iNaturalist as ’thebeachcomber’.\nI’ve also written two books: a short ebook on scientific etymology, It’s Helico-pter, not Heli-copter: A Beginner’s Guide to Deconstructing Scientific Words and Names, and a hardcover field guide, [Seashells of North Haven Beach] (https://seashellsofnorthhavenbeach.company.site).\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"About the author","uri":"/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/author/"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Categories","uri":"/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/categories/"},{"content":"","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Tags","uri":"/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/tags/"}]
