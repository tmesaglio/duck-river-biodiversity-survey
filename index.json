[{"content":"In 2020, I was looking for new green spaces to explore in western Sydney. In late April, I stumbled upon Wategora Reserve for the first time, having never visited it (or even known of its existence) beforehand. I visited a second time in early May, but then largely forgot about the reserve. In early September, however, I was starting to go a little bit crazy being stuck inside all the time during COVID lockdowns, and decided to visit Wategora again now that it was spring. After reading an information sign in the reserve, I became aware of the ‘Price List’\nThis list was a (formally unpublished) report produced by knowledgeable local Tony Price in 1979, after three years (1976-1978) of comprehensively surveying Wategora Reserve (and the nearby Rookwood Cemetery) for vascular plants. His report was published by Alison Hewitt as an appendix in her 2013 paper Revisiting Tony Price’s (1979) account of the native vegetation of Duck River and Rookwood Cemetery, western Sydney\nIn 1988, Price produced a second, updated list of native species for Wategora Reserve based on his continued observations and surveys since 1979, although this list was not made publicly accessible or published in any format; I have Colin Gibson to thank for kindly providing me with a physical copy of this document. In addition to these two lists, Judith Rawlings and John Neff conducted a brief survey of the non-native plant species in Wategora Reserve from November-December 1990; this was published as ‘Appendix No. Two’ in the 1990 physical document Duck River Open-Space Bushland Survey. Based on his observations from 1988-1992, Colin Gibson also produced an addendum (with one contribution from Francine Bell) of additional native species in the reserve that had not been observed by Price from 1976-1988, which he also shared with me.\nI consolidated these four historical species lists into a single master historical list and updated all names. From 1976-1992, a total of 522 vascular plant species were recorded from Wategora Reserve, including 285 native species from 1988-1992 and 237 non-native species from 1976-1990.\nAfter that September visit, my aim therefore became to comprehensively survey the reserve: for vascular plants, to allow a comparison with these historical data; and, for all other taxa, to establish important baseline data.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Background","uri":"/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/background/"},{"content":"Stretching ~1.3 km from north to south, and ~350 m at its widest point, my survey area covered ~25 ha (0.25 km2) across Wategora Reserve and, immediately south of it, the riverine vegetation adjacent to Everley Park. Located in western Sydney, New South Wales, the survey area spans the suburbs of Chester Hill, South Granville and Auburn, and is under the jurisdiction of Cumberland Council. It is in a highly urbanised area, and is surrounded by sporting fields, a golf course, and industrial estates and commercial properties.\nThe survey area can be split into two sections. The southern section is what I refer to as the southern riverine stretch, and consists of the eastern section of Everley Park, the riverine vegetation to the immediate east of the park, and Duck River. This vegetation belongs to the endangered ecological community River-Flat Eucalypt Forest on Coastal Floodplains of the New South Wales North Coast, Sydney Basin and South East Corner Bioregions, however, it is highly degraded and weed-infested. This section of the creek and its vegetation have undergone extensive management in the past few decades, including spraying and removal of weeds, native species plantings, and erosion control. In particular, much of the native mid- and understorey along this stretch has been planted or has self-seeded from plantings. The map below shows this section.\nThe northern section constitutes Wategora Reserve itself, including Duck River and a small tributary of it extending westwards into the reserve. The riverine vegetation along the creek is also River-Flat Eucalypt Forest, but the core vegetation throughout the reserve is Cooks River/Castlereagh Ironbark Forest of the Sydney Basin, a critically endangered ecological community. The reserve has also undergone extensive management in the past few decades, including spraying and removal of weeds, native species plantings, and erosion control, but most of the vegetation is remnant/naturally occurring. The map below shows this section.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Maps and site information","uri":"/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/maps/"},{"content":"Because my survey was designed to be comprehensive, I did not run any quadrats, transects, etc., but rather continuously surveyed the entire reserve ad nauseum. Most of the species I recorded were observed through simple active searching, but I also set up a UV lamp and moth sheet during many of my night surveys to survey insects. I endeavoured to survey as non-destructively as possible, but I did collect some insect specimens to send to experts for identification. I also collected a number of plant specimens and deposited them at the NSW Herbarium, some for identification and others for their value as vouchers.\nMy photographs were taken with a Nikon D5600 (upgraded to a Nikon D7500 during the survey) with a Tamron 18-400 lens, an Olympus Tough TG-5, and an iPhone 6s (upgraded to an iPhone 2020 SE during the survey).\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Methods","uri":"/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/methods/"},{"content":"I will keep this section brief, as it is comprehensively treated within my final report itself, but the survey area is threatened by a myriad of processes and entities, including (but not limited to) invasion by non-native species, erosion, weather extremes, pollution, and inadequate management.\nUndoubtedly, the most significant current threat to the reserve’s biodiversity is the proliferation and spread of non-native plants. During my survey I observed 309 non-native plant species, exceeding the number of natives (287). Although many of these non-natives are having little to no impact in the survey area, e.g., singular occurrences of garden escapees such as Dimorphotheca ecklonia or Dracaena draco, a great number of non-native plant species are negatively impacting the survey area’s biodiversity right now, with impacts including altered water flow, spread of disease, creation of excess shade, smothering of native trees and shrubs, and outcompetition/displacement of native species.\nProbably the greatest threat out of any non-native plant species in the survey area is the grass Ehrharta erecta. It has spread and proliferated into almost every section in the entire survey area, including the most intact and otherwise weed-free sections of bushland and woodland. Even within the short timespan of my survey, I watched it spread and increase in abundance, responding especially positively after heavy rain in 2022. In some areas, it has formed incredibly dense patches to the detriment of all other grasses and herbs. I suspect it is far too late to eliminate it entirely from the survey area, and control efforts may have to be limited to halting any further spread. Although always abundant along the creek during my survey, Tradescantia fluminensis has also exploded throughout 2022, also in response to rain, and is one of the biggest threats after Ehrharta erecta. It has now begun to invade bushland at a number of locations (e.g., it has already crept into the edges of the southern grassy woodland, and almost entirely smothered the Macrozamia spiralis growing there) and should be one of the highest priorities to deal with.\nNotably, I also observed three naturalised, non-native plant species within Wategora Reserve that were previously unrecorded by PlantNET as naturalised in NSW: Rothmannia globosa, Salvia hispanica and Ruta chalepensis.\nThe photo below highlights the now total dominance of the undergrowth by Ehrharta erecta in some sections of the reserve.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Threats","uri":"/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/threats/"},{"content":"Whilst there are many plant species that are significant or locally rare within the survey area, represented by just one or a small handful of individuals, a lot of these are more common/widely distributed across Sydney or NSW. However, as listed by James, McDougall and Benson in their 1999 Rare Bushland Plants of Western Sydney (2nd edition), there are five regionally significant plants considered rare in Western Sydney that I’ve observed in the reserve.\nVincetoxium woollsii This is the most significant plant, and perhaps the most significant species in general, that I recorded from the survey area. This is a federally and state-listed endangered species. After first being collected in the 1860s at Parramatta, it was not seen again in Sydney for almost 140 years, and indeed in the 1999 Rare Bushland Plants of Western Sydney, this species was listed as “now believed extinct in Sydney region”. However, a small patch was discovered by Colin Gibson in Norfolk Reserve, Chullora (~5.6 km southeast of Wategora Reserve) in 1999. That patch seemingly died out in the early 2000s during the Millennium Drought, but has now reappeared there after heavy rains during the La Niña conditions of the past couple of years. In November 2021, I found two individuals growing at the base of a Eucalyptus fibrosa in the reserve, a significant discovery. This population is currently unprotected and under considerable threat, with Ehrharta erecta constantly threatening to smother the two plants, and oleander aphids (Aphis nerii) attacking and defoliating the plants after jumping across from nearby patches of the invasive climber Araujia sericifera. Conserving this population should be a high priority. In late November 2021, Daniel Smart collected a small cutting (under license) of one of the two individuals and propagated it in his greenhouse. It grew rapidly, and in late September 2022 it began to flower prolifically. Flowering is yet to occur at the in situ population. Acacia pubescens\nEndemic to the Sydney region, this threatened wattle is listed as vulnerable under federal legislation. Much of its remaining occurrences are as very small patches or individuals along trainlines or roadsides, however, Wategora Reserve is one of its last bastions; it’s common and widespread throughout almost all sections of the survey area, with many large patches formed by suckering. Callistemon linearifolius Listed as vulnerable at a state level, this threatened bottlebrush is listed as a ‘data-deficient’ species by the Saving Our Species program. Scattered individuals and small stands are present throughout the reserve, totalling ~15-20 individuals. Solenogyne dominii This small Asteraceae is relatively rare in Sydney. I recorded this species at only three locations within the survey area, all of them in the northern bushland, and two of them represented by just one individual. Stackhousia muricata Another species with very few collections from Sydney, and even fewer recent records. This species appeared across a number of sections of bushland in the reserve immediately after heavy rain in mid-November 2021. ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Notable plant species","uri":"/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/important/"},{"content":"During my survey I observed a number of undescribed species, including a native mushroom (Agaricus sp.), multiple invertebrates (e.g., grasshoppers, spiders), and two phrase name plant species, Arthropodium sp. South-east Highlands (N.G.Walsh 811) Vic. Herbarium and Alternanthera sp. A Flora of New South Wales (M.Gray 5187) J.Palmer. One of these cases, however, was particularly notable.\nIn late March 2021, I found a single silverfish under a fallen Melaleuca decora bark sheet at the southwestern corner of the southern exotic grassland. It was quite active, running among bark and stick litter, and likely only came to the surface after the heavy rains and flooding in mid to late March 2021. After a family identification from entomologist Nikola Szucsich on iNaturalist, I sent my photos to researcher/expert Graeme Smith, and he noted:\n“There is only a single species of non-ateluriinae Nicoletiidae described from NSW. It was collected in caves at Bungonia near Goulburn (Subtrinemura anemonae (Smith) of the subfamily Subnicoletiinae). While I can’t say for sure I suspect your specimen represents an undescribed species close to S. anemonae. Your photos are good enough to show that it has a process on the pedicel of the antennae like one of those on S. anemonae but not good enough for me to see the other two. I thought it might also have the strange processes on the cerci but not with any confidence. If you do find any more I’d love to get a specimen or several. Even if you don’t manage to find a male, we don’t have DNA for any species of Subtrinemura so try to collect in 100% ethanol.”\nI went back four days later and, very fortunately, managed to find a male at the same spot, collected it into ethanol, and sent it to Graeme, who confirmed that it was an undescribed species:\nThe species has now been described as Subtrinemura epigea!.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Species discovery","uri":"/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/silverfish/"},{"content":"Across 378.6 hours of surveying, I recorded 1926 species.
