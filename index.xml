In late April, I stumbled upon Wategora Reserve for the first time, having never visited it (or even known of its existence) beforehand. I visited a second time in early May, but then largely forgot about the reserve. In early September, however, I was starting to go a little bit crazy being stuck inside all the time during COVID lockdowns, and decided to visit Wategora again now that it was spring.</description></item><item><title>Maps and site information</title><link>https://tmesaglio.github.io/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/maps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmesaglio.github.io/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/maps/</guid><description>Stretching ~1.3 km from north to south, and ~350 m at its widest point, my survey area covered ~25 ha (0.25 km2) across Wategora Reserve and, immediately south of it, the riverine vegetation adjacent to Everley Park. Located in western Sydney, New South Wales, the survey area spans the suburbs of Chester Hill and South Granville, and is under the jurisdiction of Cumberland Council. It is in a highly urbanised area, and is surrounded by sporting fields, a golf course, and industrial estates and commercial properties.</description></item><item><title>Threats</title><link>https://tmesaglio.github.io/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/threats/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmesaglio.github.io/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/threats/</guid><description>I will keep this section brief, as it is comprehensively treated within my final report itself, but the survey area is threatened by a myriad of processes and entities, including (but not limited to) the invasion by non-native species, erosion, weather extremes, pollution, and inadequate management.
Undoubtedly, the most significant current threat to the reserve&amp;rsquo;s biodiversity is the proliferation and spread of non-native plants. During my survey I observed 308 non-native plant species, exceeding the number of natives (287).</description></item><item><title>Notable plant species</title><link>https://tmesaglio.github.io/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/important/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmesaglio.github.io/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/important/</guid><description>Whilst there are many plant species that are significant or locally rare within the survey area, represented by just one or a small handful of individuals, a lot of these are more common/widely distributed across Sydney or NSW. However, as listed by James, McDougall and Benson in their 1999 Rare Bushland Plants of Western Sydney (2nd edition), there are five regionally significant plants considered rare in Western Sydney that I&amp;rsquo;ve observed in the reserve.</description></item><item><title>About the author</title><link>https://tmesaglio.github.io/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/author/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmesaglio.github.io/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/author/</guid><description>My name&amp;rsquo;s Thomas Mesaglio and I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD candidate at the University of New South Wales Sydney; my thesis focuses on quantifying our knowledge of Australian plant biodiversity, and developing identification tools, survey and species description protocols, and general data frameworks for improving this knowledge. Although most of my research over the past few years has focused on analyses of citizen science data, I&amp;rsquo;ve published scientific papers across a wide range of disciplines, including marine forensics, bushfire recovery and invertebrate ecology and taxonomy.</description></item></channel></rss>
