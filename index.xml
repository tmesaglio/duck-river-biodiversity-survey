Although most of my research over the past few years has focused on analyses of citizen science data, I&amp;rsquo;ve published scientific papers across a wide range of disciplines, including marine forensics, bushfire recovery and invertebrate ecology and taxonomy.</description></item><item><title>Threats</title><link>https://tmesaglio.github.io/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/threats/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmesaglio.github.io/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/threats/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Maps and site information</title><link>https://tmesaglio.github.io/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/maps/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmesaglio.github.io/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/maps/</guid><description>Stretching ~1.3 km from north to south, and ~350 m at its widest point, my survey area covered ~25 ha (0.25 km2) across Wategora Reserve and, immediately south of it, the riverine vegetation adjacent to Everley Park. Located in western Sydney, New South Wales, the survey area spans the suburbs of Chester Hill and South Granville, and is under the jurisdiction of Cumberland Council. It is in a highly urbanised area, and is surrounded by sporting fields, a golf course, and industrial estates and commercial properties.</description></item><item><title>Background</title><link>https://tmesaglio.github.io/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/background/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tmesaglio.github.io/duck-river-biodiversity-survey/background/</guid><description>In 2020, I was looking for new green spaces to explore in western Sydney. In late April, I stumbled upon Wategora Reserve for the first time, having never visited it (or even known of its existence) beforehand. I visited a second time in early May, but then largely forgot about the reserve. In early September, however, I was starting to go a little bit crazy being stuck inside all the time during COVID lockdowns, and decided to visit Wategora again now that it was spring.</description></item></channel></rss>
